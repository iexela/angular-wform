# angular-wform

This library allows to work with Angular Reactive Form declaratively, which makes it even more powerful.

## (!!!) This Library is in Active Development (!!!)

It means that
* It is not ready for use in the production
* It is not tested for all target Angular versions (7+)
* Its documentation is not very well.
    * It has many syntax and grammar errors
    * It is not full
    * It is organized not in the best way
* It is not integrated with any CI system
* ...

There is a [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) with some details (but they are not too detailed, actually).
